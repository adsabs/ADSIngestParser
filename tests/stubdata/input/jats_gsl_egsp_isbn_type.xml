<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Swelling and shrinking soils are soils that can experience large changes in volume due to changes in water content. This may be due to seasonal changes in moisture content, local site changes such as leakage from water supply pipes or drains, changes to surface drainage and landscaping, or following the planting, removal or severe pruning of trees or hedges. These soils represent a significant hazard to structural engineers across the world due to their shrink–swell behaviour, with the cost of mitigation alone running into several billion pounds annually. These soils usually contain some form of clay mineral, such as smectite or vermiculite, and can be found in humid and arid/semi-arid environments where their expansive nature can cause significant damage to properties and infrastructure. This chapter discusses the properties and costs associated with shrink–swell soils, their formation and distribution throughout the UK and the rest of the world, and their geological and geotechnical characterization. It also considers the mechanisms of shrink-swell soils and their behaviour, reviewing strategies for managing them in an engineering context, before finally outlining the problem of trees and shrink–swell soils.</p>

<sec id="s1"><label>8.1</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Shrink–swell soils are one of the most costly and widespread geological hazards globally, with costs estimated to run into several billion pounds annually. These soils present significant geotechnical and structural challenges to anyone wishing to build on, or in, them. Shrink–swell occurs as a result of changes in the moisture content of clay-rich soils. This is reflected in a change in volume of the ground through shrinking or swelling. Swelling pressures can cause heave, or lifting, of structures, while shrinkage can cause differential settlement.</p>
<p>This chapter aims to provide the reader with a basic understanding of shrink–swell soils. To do this, we will review the nature and extent of shrink–swell soils, both in the UK and worldwide, and discuss how they form, how they can be recognized, the mechanisms and behaviour of shrink–swell soils, and strategies for their management (including avoidance, prevention and mitigation). This chapter also includes a glossary of terms (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix</xref>), and is illustrated throughout with references and recommendations for further reading.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2"><label>8.2</label><title>Properties of shrink–swell soils</title>
<p>A shrink–swell soil is one that changes in volume in response to changes in its moisture content. The extent of the volumetric change reflects the type and proportion of swelling clay in the soil. More specifically, expansive clay minerals expand by absorbing water and contract, or shrink, as they release water and dry out. Clays range in their potential to absorb water according to their different structures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="EGSP29_8TB1">Table 8.1</xref>). For the most expansive clays, expansions of 10% are common. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C18">Chen 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C55">Nelson &amp; Miller 1992</xref>).</p>

<p>In practice, the amount by which the ground shrinks and/or swells is determined by the water content in the near-surface (active) zone. Soil moisture in this zone responds to changes in the availability of atmospheric recharge and the effects of evapotranspiration. These effects usually extend to about 3 m depth, but this may be increased by the presence of tree roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C23">Driscoll 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C5">Biddle 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C6">2001</xref>). Characteristically fine-grained clay-rich soils soften, becoming sticky and heavy, following recharge events such as rainfall; commonly, they can absorb significant volumes of water. Conversely, as they dry, shrinking and cracking of the ground is associated with a hardening of the clay at surface. Structural changes in the soil during shrinkage (e.g. alignment of clay particles) ensure that swelling and shrinkage are not fully reversible processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C32">Holtz &amp; Kovacs 1981</xref>). For example, the cracks that form during soil shrinkage are not perfectly annealed on re-wetting. This volume increase results in a decrease in the soil density, thereby providing enhanced access by water for subsequent episodes of swelling. Over geological timescales, shrinkage cracks may become infilled with sediment, thus imparting heterogeneity to the soil. Once the cracks have been infilled in this way, the soil is unable to move back, leaving a zone with a network of higher-permeability infills.</p>
<p>When supporting structures, the effects of significant changes in water content on soils with a high shrink–swell potential can be severe. In practical civil engineering applications in the UK, there are three important time-dependent situations, each with different boundary conditions, where shrink–swell processes need to be considered.
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Following a reduction in mean total stress, the most notable effects are found adjacent to cut slopes, excavations and tunnels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C72">Vaughan &amp; Walbancke 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C29">Grob 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C15">Burland <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C28">Einstein 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C48">Madsen &amp; Muller-Vonmoos 1985</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Subsurface groundwater abstraction or artificial/natural recharge under conditions of constant total stress in both unconfined and confined aquifers. Regional subsidence or heave can be induced by this process.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Surface climatic and/or water balance fluctuations related to land-use change under conditions of constant total stress. The most notable effects follow the development of seasonally desiccated soils (shrinkage), which can cause structural damage to existing shallow foundation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C23">Driscoll 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C70">Taylor &amp; Smith 1986</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>As well as effective stress changes, some deformation may be caused by biogeochemical alteration and dissolution of minerals, as a result of ‘steady-state’ fluid transport processes. Although surface movements and engineering problems can occur due to a loss or addition of solid material, these are not strictly shrink–swell soils. However, these processes are often combined with effective stress changes and/or fluid movements, and may be difficult to separate from true shrink–swell processes that might be taking place at the same time.</p>
<p>The chief factors controlling shrink–swell susceptibility in geological formations are material composition (clay mineralogy), initial <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> effective stress state and stiffness of the material. Variations in the initial condition caused through processes such as original geological environment, climate, topography, land use and weathering affect <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> effective stresses and stiffness, and hence shrink–swell susceptibility. Clays belonging to the silicate family comprise the major elements silicone, aluminium and oxygen. There are many other elements that can become incorporated into the clay mineral structure (hydrogen, sodium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur). The presence and abundance of these dissolved ions can have a large impact on the behaviour of the clay minerals. The clay minerals are defined by the ratio of silica tetrahedra to alumina, iron or magnesium octahedra.</p>
<p>Subsidence also occurs in superficial deposits such as alluvium, peat and laminated clays that are susceptible to consolidation settlement (e.g. in the Vale of York east of Leeds, and in the Cheshire Basin), but these are not true shrink–swell soils.</p>

<sec id="s3"><label>8.3</label><title>Costs associated with shrink–swell clay damage</title>
<p>Clay shrink–swell is a global problem, and many of the world's major towns and cities are founded on clay-rich soils and rocks. In the UK the effects of shrinkage and swelling of clay soils with respect to foundation and building damage were first recognized by geotechnical specialists following the dry summer of 1947. Following the drought of 1975–1976, insurance claims in the UK came to over £50 million and the cost has risen dramatically since then. After a preceding drought in 1991, claims peaked at over £500 million. Over the past 10 years the adverse effects of shrink–swell behaviour has cost the economy an estimated £3 billion, making it the most damaging geohazard in Britain today; as many as one in five homes in England and Wales are at risk from ground that swells when it becomes wet and shrinks as it dries out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C40">Jones 2004</xref>), although susceptible ground conditions are perhaps less severe under a temperate UK climate than in some other countries. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) has estimated that the average cost of shrink–swell-related subsidence to the insurance industry stands at over £400 million a year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C24">Driscoll &amp; Crilly 2000</xref>). The ABI stated that the 350% increase in the value of claims during July to September 2018 was the highest quarterly jump since records started more than 25 years ago. In the USA, the estimated damage to buildings and infrastructure exceeds $15 billion annually. The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that one in four homes have some damage caused by shrink–swell soils; in a typical year, such soils cause a greater financial loss to property owners than earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and tornadoes combined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C55">Nelson &amp; Miller 1992</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s4"><label>8.4</label><title>Formation processes</title>
<p>Clay minerals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="EGSP29_8TB1">Table 8.1</xref>) are a product of weathering. They mostly form on land but are often transported to the oceans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C27">Eberl 1984</xref>). They can form through three mechanisms: inheritance, or sediment transport; neoformation, from solution or reaction of amorphous material; or transformation, retaining some of the inherent structure while undergoing chemical reaction. As weathering proceeds silica and potassium are gradually leached; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C27">Eberl (1984)</xref> cites a number of case studies that demonstrate how wet climates are associated with kaolinite-rich soils while dry environments are characterized by smectite clays. The distribution of clay minerals at the surface therefore reflects both the underlying geology and the nature of weathering. In addition to the material composition (clay mineralogy; <xref ref-type="table" rid="EGSP29_8TB1">Table 8.1</xref>), the main factors controlling shrink–swell susceptibility in geological formations are: depositional environment, diagenesis, stress history and weathering. These factors influence the <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> effective stress state and stiffness of the material, and therefore its propensity to swell.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the clay minerals derived from weathering are transported to the ocean where they undergo little reaction, except for ion exchange and neoformation of smectite, which is associated with volcanic activity in the oceans and demonstrates the influence of geotectonic setting on clay mineral distribution. Clay mineralogy is also affected by diagenesis and stress history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C43">Keller 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C27">Eberl 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C49">Merriman 2005</xref>). Broadly, diagenesis takes the form of smectite to illite transformations. Illitization proceeds through a series of reactions involving intermediate mixed layers of illite and smectite of varying compositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C45">Lanson <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). Near-surface weathering can reverse this process, leading to the formation of mixed layer clays. While the stress history can be important in influencing clay mineralogy, it has been argued that the influences of burial depth on engineering properties is less significant than that of stratigraphical position (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C36">Jackson &amp; Fookes 1974</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5"><label>8.5</label><title>Distribution</title>
<p>Shrink–swell soils are found throughout many regions of the world, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions, as well as where wet conditions occur after prolonged periods of drought. Their distribution is dependent on geology (parent material), climate, hydrology and geomorphology and vegetation, and is susceptibile to environmental change (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C30">Harrison <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Countries where shrink–swell soils occur and give rise to major construction costs include: Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Morocco, South Africa and Zimbabwe in Africa; Burma, China, India, Iran, Israel, Japan and Oman in Asia; Argentina, Canada, Cuba, Mexico, Trinidad, USA and Venezuela in the Americas; Cyprus, Germany, Greece, Norway, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the UK in Europe; and Australia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EGSP29_8F1">Fig. 8.1</xref>). In these countries, or significant areas of them, the evaporation rate is higher than the annual rainfall so there is usually a moisture deficiency in the soil; soil suction then increases the potential for heave. In semi-arid regions a pattern of short periods of rainfall followed by long dry periods (drought) can develop, resulting in seasonal cycles of swelling and shrinkage.</p>

<p>In humid climates problems with shrink–swell soils trend to be limited to those soils containing higher plasticity clays. In arid or semi-arid climates, soils that exhibit moderate shrink–swell potential can cause distress to residential property. This occurs as a direct result of the relatively high suction that exists in these soils, and the larger changes in water content regimes that results when water level changes.</p>
<p>Reflecting the broad younging of the UK stratigraphy to the SE, the clay-rich soils most susceptible to shrink–swell behaviour predominate in the SE of the country, primarily distributed to the east of a line from Dorset to Birmingham, Nottingham and North Yorkshire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EGSP29_8F2">Fig. 8.2</xref>). In this zone the near-surface Jurassic, Paleocene and Eocene clays are less indurated than their older counterparts, and they retain a greater propensity to absorb and lose moisture. These mudrocks are normally firm to very stiff clays or very weak mudstones that weather to firm to stiff clays near the surface. Indurated clays are less prone to shrink–swell behaviour because of the clay transformations that occur during diagenesis.</p>

<p>The transformations associated with diagenesis are attributable to the changes in the stress, fluid pressure, geochemistry and temperature as a consequence of burial. Associated with the clay transformation are compaction and fluid migration, development of diagenetic bonds, mineralization and cementation, recrystallization and pressure solution. In some areas of the UK (e.g. around the Wash, NW of Peterborough, and under the Lancashire Plain) the mudrocks are deeply buried beneath other (superficial) soils that are not as susceptible to shrink–swell behaviour, although consideration should be given to the potential for swelling and heave in deep excavations in these soils.</p>
<p>While the two-dimensional (2D) distribution of the UK clay soils is relatively well known (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C47">Loveland 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C75">Wilson <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C37">Jeans 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C38">b</xref>), the 3D distribution is less well known. There is significant potential for furthering this understanding through the use of 3D geological models (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C42">Jones &amp; Terrington 2011</xref>). Indications are that climate change will have an increasingly adverse effect on the moisture conditions that UK soils experience and therefore on the damage caused to the homes, buildings, roads and services founded on them, with further potential for the application of 3D geological modelling.</p>
<p>A meaningful assessment of the shrink–swell potential of a soil in the UK requires a considerable amount of high-quality and well-distributed spatial data of a consistent standard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C41">Jones &amp; Jefferson 2012</xref>), and from this a volume change potential (VCP) map can be constructed. However, although giving a good indication of potential problem areas, looking at soils on a national scale does not tell the whole story. No two clay soils are the same in terms of their behaviour or their shrink–swell potential; it is therefore better to look at them on a more regional scale. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C42">Jones &amp; Terrington (2011)</xref> discuss a methodology for creating a 3D VCP interpolation of the London Clay, visualizing plasticity values at a variety of depths relative to ground level across the outcrop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EGSP29_8F3">Fig. 8.3</xref>).</p>

</sec>
<sec id="s6"><label>8.6</label><title>Characterization of shrink–swell soils</title>
<p>Shrink–swell soils can be recognized from either geological and geotechnical characterization, or from the damage incurred by buildings and infrastructure. Typically, swelling pressures can cause heave or lifting of structures, while shrinkage can cause differential settlement. Damage to a structure is possible when as little as 3% volume expansion takes place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C39">Jones 2002</xref>). Failure results when the volume changes are unevenly distributed beneath the foundation. For example, water content changes in the soil around the edge of a building can cause swelling pressure beneath the perimeter of the building (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EGSP29_8F4">Fig. 8.4</xref>), while the water content of the soil beneath the centre remains constant. This results in a failure known as end lift. Conversely, soil shrinkage around the perimeter may result in centre lift. Subsidence problems are easier to recognize than heave problems; this may occur on a dry clay soil and the only obvious sign might be irregular crack patterns, wider at the bottom than at the top, with no obvious cause.</p>

<p>Another major contributing factor to ground shrinkage is tree growth, more specifically tree roots. Roots grow in the direction of least resistance and where they have the best access to water, air and nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C65">Roberts 1976</xref>). The actual pattern of root growth depends upon, among other factors, the type of tree, depth to water table and local ground conditions. Trees will tend to maintain a compact root system. However, when trees become very large, or where trees are under stress, they can send root systems far from the trunk. Damage to foundations resulting from tree growth occurs in two principal ways: physical disturbance or shrinkage of the ground by removal of water. Physical disturbance of the ground caused by root growth is often seen as damage to pavements and broken walls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EGSP29_8F5">Fig. 8.5</xref>). Shrinkage caused by water removal can lead to differential settlement of building foundations. Vegetation-induced changes to water profiles can also have a significant impact on other underground features, including utilities. Tree-induced movement has the potential to be a significant contributor to failure of old pipes located in clay soils near deciduous trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C20">Clayton <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2010</xref>), and can also cause physical disturbance to services.</p>

<p>Potential shrinkage and/or swelling from these causes can usually be anticipated in most engineering circumstances. However, because of the differences between natural and tree-induced shrink–swell, and varying initial conditions, the relative susceptibility to volume change at any place may not necessarily always be the same for a given geological formation or soil type. Spatial generalization is therefore difficult, and a prediction of the severity of potential deformation often requires site-specific subsurface investigations and <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> monitoring.</p>
<p>To summarize, the main environmental causes of shrink–swell are: (1) normal seasonal movements associated with changes in rainfall and vegetation growth; (2) enhanced seasonal movement associated with trees, severe pruning or removal of trees or hedges; (3) long-term subsidence, as a persistent water deficit develops; (4) long-term heave as a persistent water deficit dissipates; or (5) increased susceptibility of the near-surface soils as its density is reduced.</p>
<p>While much research has been carried out worldwide to infer shrink–swell behaviour from soil index properties, few direct data are publically available in UK geotechnical databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C31">Hobbs <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 1998</xref>). Two schemes that are commonly used to assess shrink–swell properties within the UK are based on the Building Research Establishment (BRE) and National House-Builders Council (NHBC) schemes. High-shrinkage soils may not behave very differently from low-shrinkage soils, because conditions in the UK do not allow full potential to be realized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C63">Reeve <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>Potential shrink–swell soils are initially identified by soils engineers from particle size analyses to determine the percentage of fine particles in a sample. If more than 35% of the particles are able to pass through a 63 µm sieve, the sample is classified as a fine soil comprising either silt or clay, or a combination of both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C14">BSI 1999</xref>). Clay-sized particles are considered to be less than 2 µm (although this value varies slightly throughout the world), but the difference between clays and silts is more to do with origin and particle shape. Silt particles (generally comprising quartz particles) are products of mechanical erosion, whereas clay particles are products of chemical weathering and are characterized by their sheet structure and composition.</p>
<p>Although there are a number of methods available to identify shrink–swell soils, each with their relative merits, there are no universally reliable methods available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C41">Jones &amp; Jefferson 2012</xref>), and they are rarely employed in the course of routine site investigations in the UK. This means that few data are available for compiling the directly measured shrink–swell properties of the major clay formations, and reliance has to be placed on estimates based on index parameters such as liquid limit, plasticity index and density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C63">Reeve <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C32">Holtz &amp; Kovacs 1981</xref>). No consideration has been given to the saturation state of the soil and therefore to the effective stress or pore pressures within it.</p>
<p>The most widely used parameter for determining the shrinkage and swelling potential of a soil is the plasticity index (<italic toggle="yes">I</italic><sub>P</sub>). Such plasticity parameters, being based on remoulded specimens, cannot precisely predict the shrink–swell behaviour of an <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> soil. However, they do follow established procedures, being performed under reproducible conditions to internationally recognized standards. A modified plasticity index (<italic toggle="yes">I</italic><sub>P</sub>') is proposed in the Building Research Establishment Digest 240 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C78">BRE 1993</xref>) for use where the particle size data, specifically the fraction passing a 425 µm sieve, is known or can be assumed as 100% passing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C78">BRE 1993</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">I</italic><sub>P</sub>' takes into account the whole sample and not just the fines fraction; it therefore gives a better indication of the real plasticity value of an engineering soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C42">Jones &amp; Terrington 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Such empirical correlations may be based on a small dataset, using a specific test method, and at only a small number of sites. Variation of the test method would probably lead to errors in the correlation. The reason for the lack of direct shrink–swell test data is that few engineering applications have a perceived requirement for these data for design or construction. However, the stages of investigation needed for shrink–swell soils follow those used for any site (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C46">Leroueil 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C67">Simons <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2002</xref>). Indications are that climate change will have an increasingly adverse effect on the moisture conditions that UK clay soils experience, and therefore on the damage caused to the structures founded on, or within, them. The government has recognized that climate change is one of the biggest problems that the UK faces and, if current predictions are correct, we can expect hotter, drier summers and milder, wetter winters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C71">UKCIP 2009</xref>), with as many as one in five homes in England and Wales likely to be damaged by the shrinking and swelling behaviour of these clay soils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C40">Jones 2004</xref>). If the UK were to experience an increase in extended periods of dry weather prior to rainfall events, costs caused by shrink–swell damage could rise significantly. It is therefore important to recognize the existence of shrink–swell soils at the earliest stage possible, during site and laboratory investigations, in order to ensure that the correct design procedures are put in place, before costly remediation is required.</p>
<p>Soil suction is a measure of the free energy or the relative vapour pressure (relative humidity) of the soil moisture. It can be defined by the suction required to remove the water from above the water table. There are two components: the matric potential, which is the moisture held in soil pores by capillary action; and the much smaller solute potential, which is the osmotic effect of dissolved salts. Soil suction characteristics vary between clay soils in accordance with the composition of the soil, particularly its particle size and clay mineral content. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="EGSP29_8F6">Figure 8.6</xref> shows typical moisture content suction profiles for a variety of UK and North American mudrocks.</p>

<p>The hydraulic conductivity of a soil also varies with the suction, both seasonally and over longer timescales. A secondary permeability can be induced through fabric changes, tension cracking and shallow shear failure during the shrink–swell process which may influence subsequent moisture movements. For example, in a micro fabric study of clay soils, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C66">Scott <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (1986)</xref> showed that compression (swelling) cracks tended to parallel ground contours and dip into the slope at <italic toggle="yes">c.</italic> 60°, and could usually be distinguished from shrinkage cracks that were randomly distributed. In the London Clay Formation soils studied, they found that the ratio between shrinkage and swelling discontinuities was about 2:1. The actual mechanism of volume increase (or decrease), and the differences in susceptibility to these processes that have been found between different sediments, has been attributed to a combination of both mechanical and physicochemical processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C8">Bolt 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C51">Mitchell 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C70">Taylor &amp; Smith 1986</xref>).</p>

<p>Ground deformation in response to a reduction in total stress can be considered in terms of: (a) an immediate, but time–dependent, elastic rebound; and (2) swelling due to the change in effective stress.</p>
<p>Changes in effective stress drive fluid movement into or out of the geological formation or soil. The magnitude of strains associated with this process depends on the drained stiffness, the extent of the stress change, the water pressures that are set up in the soil or rock, and the new boundary conditions. The rate of volume change depends on the compressibility, expansibility and hydraulic conductivity of the sediment and surrounding materials. In stiff homogeneous materials with a low hydraulic conductivity, several decades may be necessary to complete the process. The same physical parameters and processes control the swelling that accompanies atmospheric-driven aquifer recharge; however, without a total stress change there is no elastic rebound of the soil and/or rock structure.</p>
<p>Shrinkage by evaporation is similarly accompanied by a reduction in water pressure and development of negative capillary pressures; deformation follows the same principles of effective stress. The processes of shrinkage due to evaporation have been reviewed in detail using effective stress concepts by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C68">Sridharan &amp; Venkatappa Rao (1971)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C7">Bishop <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (1975)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C1">Alonso <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (1990)</xref>.</p>
<p>At any time, the equilibrium water content in a geological formation or weathered soil represents a balance between the clay minerals needed to suck in water, and the tendency for applied stresses to squeeze out water. A clay and/or soil mass initially in equilibrium will swell if a transient change in geoenvironmental boundary conditions results in unloading or an increase in water pressure. As corollaries to the three situations of shrink–swell associated with anthropogenic interference (engineering works), there are also three comparable groups of natural causes: (1) a total stress change following erosion, tectonism or mass movement; (2) climatically controlled hydrodynamic processes associated with sea-level change, and groundwater recharge and discharge; and (3) biogenic, chemical and/or physical weathering under conditions of almost constant total stress.</p>
<p>Freeze–thaw involves effective stress changes, and is a natural cause of shrink–swell. It is extremely important in northern latitudes; the top few metres of most weathered materials in the UK were affected by freeze–thaw processes during the late glacial period. However, examples of heave are known to have occurred next to some refrigeration plants and beneath road pavements, and it may also have contributed to some slope instability problems. A review of research progress in this field, as well as a good starting point and bibliography for the subject, is provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C53">Morgenstern (1981)</xref>.</p>
<p>Civil engineering and other anthropogenic interference essentially mimic these natural effects through environmental changes connected with construction, artificial groundwater recharge, agriculture and/or waste disposal, but their effects are superimposed onto a range of initial time-dependent conditions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s8"><label>8.8</label><title>Shrink–swell behaviour</title>
<p>The shape of clay particles is determined by the arrangement of the thin crystal lattice layers that they form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EGSP29_8F7">Fig. 8.7</xref>). The molecular structure and arrangement of the clay crystal sheets in shrink–swell clays guides how water is attracted and held between the crystalline layers (and on their surfaces) in a strongly bonded ‘sandwich’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EGSP29_8F7">Fig. 8.7</xref>), an example of which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="EGSP29_8F8">Figure 8.8</xref>. The electrical dipole structure of water molecules drive an electrochemical attraction to the microscopic clay sheets. The mechanism by which these molecules become attached to each other is called adsorption. Na-smectite clays (such as montmorillonite) have the greatest affinity for water, and can adsorb very large amounts of water molecules between their clay sheets. In theory, they can expand in volume by a factor of 800, causing dispersion of clay platelets by the elimination of repulsive interlayer forces. They therefore have a large shrink–swell potential, as do vermiculite and chlorite, which exhibit crystalline swelling. For further details of mineralogy of clay minerals and their influence of engineering properties of soils, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C52">Mitchell &amp; Soga (2005)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C23">Driscoll (1983)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C69">Taylor &amp; Cripps (1984)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C70">Taylor &amp; Smith (1986)</xref> provide useful reviews of the controls that clay mineralogy has on the drained compressibility and/or expansibility of geological materials, and hence their susceptibility to large deformations from effective stress changes which lead to shrinkage and/or swelling.</p>


<p>Saturated clay shrink–swell soils contain water molecules between the clay sheets, causing the bulk volume of the soil to increase or swell with changes in water content. This process of absorption weakens the inter-clay bonds and causes a reduction in the strength of the soil. As moisture is reduced by evaporation or gravitational forces, the water between the clay sheets is released, causing the overall volume of the soil to decrease or shrink. Features such as voids or desiccation cracks are associated with this process.</p>
<p>Shrinkage and swelling usually occurs in the near-surface to depths of about 3 m, but this can vary depending on climatic conditions. The shrink–swell potential of expansive soils is determined by its initial water content, void ratio, internal structure and vertical stresses, as well as the type and amount of clay minerals in the soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C4">Bell &amp; Culshaw 2001</xref>). These minerals determine the natural expansiveness of the soil, and include smectite, montmorillonite, nontronite, vermiculite, illite and chlorite. Generally, the greater the concentration of these minerals in the soil, the greater the shrink–swell potential. However, these effects may become diluted by the presence of other non-swelling minerals such as quartz and carbonite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C44">Kemp <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Soils with high shrink–swell potential will not usually cause problems as long as their water content remains relatively constant. This is controlled by the soil properties (mineralogy), suction and water conditions, water content variations, and geometry and stiffness of a structure founded on it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C33">Houston <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2011</xref>). In a partially saturated soil, suction or water content changes increase the likelihood of damage occurring. In a fully saturated soil, the shrink–swell behaviour is controlled by the clay mineralogy.</p>
<p>Seasonal volume change generally takes place with the assistance of fractures and secondary macropores within the weathered horizons. If undersaturation is present at very shallow depths, slaking by air breakage can also occur. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C70">Taylor &amp; Smith (1986)</xref> described these processes, and the physicochemical techniques for predicting structural breakdown. The depth of active groundwater flow is therefore an important control on the susceptibility of soils to volume change, because this affects the magnitude of that change in both the saturated and unsaturated groundwater zones.</p>
<p>Shrink–swell soil problems typically occur due to water content changes in the upper few metres, with deep-seated heave being rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C55">Nelson &amp; Miller 1992</xref>). The water content in this zone, which is known as the active layer, is significantly influenced by climatic and environmental factors; it is generally termed the zone of seasonal fluctuations or active zone, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="EGSP29_8F9">Figure 8.9</xref>.</p>

<p>In the zone of seasonal fluctuations, moisture content ranges between negative and positive porewater pressures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EGSP29_8F9">Fig. 8.9</xref>); see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C56">Nelson <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2001)</xref> for further details. It is important to determine the depth of the active zone during a site investigation in order to ensure adequate foundation design. This can vary significantly with climate conditions with depths of 5–6 m in some countries, whereas in the UK 1.5–2.0 m is typical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C6">Biddle 2001</xref>), extending to 3–4 m in some areas of the London Clay Formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C6">Biddle 2001</xref>). Depending on the relative significance of heave or subsidence, the active zone is defined in one of a number of ways (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C56">Nelson <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2001</xref>).

</list>The natural, time-dependent physical and chemical changes which occur in a geological formation are inherent weathering processes. In a stiff clay, the result is one of softening (i.e. an increased water content), while in a soft clay a hardened crust is often formed in association with desiccation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C50">Mesri <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (1978)</xref> provide a useful summary of the reasons why softening and weathering processes are dependent on time.

</list>Superimposed on these widespread climatic influences are local influences such as tree roots and leakage from water supply pipes and drains. The removal or severe pruning of trees may result in swelling problems, as extraction through root systems is the most efficient method of supplying water to desiccated soils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C19">Cheney 1986</xref>). The swelling of shrinkable clay soils after trees have been removed can produce either very large uplifts or very large pressures (if confined), and the ground recovery can continue over a period of many years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C19">Cheney 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Building or paving on previously open areas of land, such as the building of patios and driveways, can cause major disruption to the soil–water system. Sealing the ground in this way cuts off the infiltration of rainwater; the trees that are dependent upon this water will have to send their roots deeper or further afield in order to find water. The movement of these root systems will cause a major ground disturbance, and will lead to the removal of water from a larger area around the tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C41">Jones &amp; Jefferson 2012</xref>). Problems occur when structures are situated within the zone of influence of a tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EGSP29_8F10">Fig. 8.10</xref>).</p>

<p>Occasionally this situation may worsen as nearby trees continue to extract water during the growing months, when rainfall is low. If a more permeable type of surface, such as block paving, is used, more rainwater can enter the ground and supply nearby tree roots. If an impermeable method of paving is used, it may prevent water from infiltrating into the ground. This can affect the shrink–swell behaviour of the ground and also the growing patterns of nearby trees. A well-designed impermeable paving system, and one that is in good condition, may actually reduce the amount of shrink–swell activity in the ground immediately below it. Paving moderates variations in water content of the soil and therefore the range of shrink–swell behaviour that might be expected. However, if the paving seal is broken water can suddenly enter the system, causing swelling of the ground.</p>
<p>Trees are a vital component of the environment and play an important role valued by the public at large for many different reasons. However, trees are also a very real problem when they shed their leaves, petals and fruit or block out sunlight, and their roots are associated with cracked pavements and blocked drains; further, where tree roots are close to buildings in the presence of shrink–swell soils, building subsidence can occur. If vegetation is involved, it produces a characteristic seasonal pattern of foundation movement of subsidence during summer, reaching a maximum usually in September, followed by upwards recovery during winter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C21">Crilly &amp; Driscoll 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C25">Driscoll &amp; Chown 2001</xref>). This pattern provides clear evidence of clay shrink–swell as as no other cause produces a similar pattern, and it can be concluded that soil drying by vegetation must be involved (unless the foundations are less than 300 mm).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s9"><label>8.9</label><title>Strategies for engineering management: avoidance, prevention and mitigation</title>
<p>The structures most susceptible to damage caused by shrink–swell soils are usually lightweight in construction. Houses and other low-rise buildings, pavements, pylons, pipelines and other shallow services are especially vulnerable to damage because they are less able to suppress differential movements than heavier multi-storey structures. Due to the global distribution of shrink–swell soils, many different ways to tackle the problem have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C62">Radevsky 2001</xref>). The preferred methodology depends on technical developments, country-specific legal frameworks and regulations, insurance policies and the attitude of insurers, the experience of the engineers and other specialists dealing with the problem and, most importantly, the sensitivity of the owner of the property affected. A summary of these issues is provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C62">Radevsky (2001)</xref> in his review of how different countries deal with shrink–swell soil problems, and a detailed informative study from the USA has more recently been presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C33">Houston <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2011)</xref>.</p>
<p>In order to make a proper characterization of a site where shrink–swell soils exist, two factors need to be identified: (1) the properties of the soil (e.g. mineralogy, soil water chemistry, suction, soils fabric); and (2) environmental conditions that can contribute to changes in water contents of the soil, for example, water conditions and their variations (climate, drainage, vegetation, permeability and temperature) and stress conditions (history and <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> conditions, loading and soil profile).</p>
<p>Shrink–swell soils require extensive site investigation in order to provide sufficient information, normal investigations, relating to the structures most affected by shrink–swell soils, are often not adequate. These investigations may involve specialist test programmes even for relatively lightweight structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C55">Nelson &amp; Miller 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>While the selection of the type of foundation can be critical in the mitigation of clay shrink–swell, there are a number of factors that influence the selection of foundation types and design methods including climate, local experience, financial and legal aspects, and technical issues. If shrink–swell clays have been identified, the design should take account of the depth of the active layer and the fact that shrink–swell behaviour often does not manifest itself for several months; early communication with all relevant stakeholders is essential. Often higher initial costs are offset many times over by a reduction in post-construction maintenance costs dealing with expansive soils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C55">Nelson &amp; Miller 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Foundation alternatives when dealing with potentially expansive soils are likely to require one of a number of structural alternatives designed to either isolate the structure from soil movement (e.g. using drilled pier and beam foundations) or introduce sufficient stiffness to resist movement (e.g. using stiffened slab on grade or modified continuous perimeter footings) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C41">Jones &amp; Jefferson 2012</xref>). The use of ground improvement techniques in isolation or in combination with these approaches may be a good alternative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C18">Chen 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C55">Nelson &amp; Miller 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C57">Nelson <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C41">Jones &amp; Jefferson 2012</xref>). Of particular importance is the aim to minimize total and differential movements. Globally, the most common types of foundations used in expansive soils are drilled pier and beam systems, reinforced slabs-on-grade and modified continuous perimeter spread footings.</p>
<p>Pavements are particularly susceptible to damage caused by shrink–swell soils. Their vulnerability stems from their relative lightweight nature extended over a relatively large area. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C17">Cameron (2006)</xref> described problems with railways built on shrink–swell soils where poor drainage exists, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C76">Zheng <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2009)</xref> describes problems with highway subgrade construction on embankments and slopes in China. Damage to pavements on shrink–swell soils manifests in a number of ways, including severe unevenness along significant lengths of pavement (sometimes evidenced by cracks); longitudinal cracking; lateral cracking developed from significant localized deformations, and localized pavement failure associated with disintegration of the surface. A detailed account of a range of treatment approaches is described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C18">Chen (1988)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C55">Nelson &amp; Miller (1992)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C61">Petry &amp; Little (2002)</xref> provide a detailed review of the use of stabilization techniques over the last 60 years.</p>
<p>The philosophy of pavement design is essentially the same as that used for foundations. However, a range of different approaches are required to overcome the difficulty of it not being possible to isolate the pavement from the soils, and it is impractical to make pavements stiff enough to avoid differential movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C41">Jones &amp; Jefferson 2012</xref>). Pavement designs are considered based on either flexible or rigid pavement systems; see the <italic toggle="yes">Manual of Contract Documents for Highway Works</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C22">DETR 1993</xref>). Decision-making with respect to pavement design in shrink–swell soils should be based on comprehensive ground understanding, in the context of the project requirements.</p>
<p>Conceptual ground models should include, but not be limited by: the depth of the active zone, the potential for volume change, soil and soil water chemistry, the distribution and seasonality of moisture in the soil, soil permeability and soil structure. Failure to carry out an adequate site investigation can lead to false diagnoses and the use of inappropriate remedial measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C55">Nelson &amp; Miller 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>A number of solutions are available for the management of shrink–swell soils (<xref ref-type="table" rid="EGSP29_8TB1">Table 8.1</xref>). As fluctuations in water contents are one of the primary drivers of shrink–swell problems, with non-uniform heave occurring due to non-uniformity of water contents, shrink–swell problems could be mitigated by minimizing moisture content change over time. Moreover, if moisture content changes can be slowed down and moisture distributions made uniform, then differential movement could also be reduced. The lowest-technology approach is avoidance and the selection of alternative routes. Engineered solutions include: replacement of expansive soil with a non-expansive alternative; a modified design based on a low-strength soil with a requirement for regular maintenance; improvement of the expansive soils through disturbance and recompaction; stabilization of the expansive soil through chemical additives (e.g. lime treatment); or the advanced-technology approach of moisture control over the life of the pavement. Details of these are provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C18">Chen (1988)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C55">Nelson &amp; Miller (1992)</xref>. There is a legacy of negative perceptions associated with some techniques, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C33">Houston <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> (2011)</xref> found that many geotechnical and structural engineers considered chemical stabilization approaches such as the use of lime as ineffective for the pretreatment of shrink–swell soils for foundations.</p>
<p>As with new construction on shrink–swell soils, mitigation projects should be appraised in the context of a number of scoping questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C41">Jones &amp; Jefferson 2012</xref>) feeding into a good conceptual ground model. For example, are remedial measures needed or is damage severe enough to warrant treatment? What are the ground conditions and processes driving the damage? Has the problem stabilized and when should intervention take place? Is the full extent of the problem known? In the context of the ground model, the detail with respect to the options available for remediation and its specification in terms of design and quality assurance can be addressed. Further, the economic questions around funding sources and post-remedial residual risks (e.g. in the context of localized treatment) can also be answered.</p>
<p>Examples of remedial measures employed for mitigation of foundation-related failures in shrink–swell soils include (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C41">Jones &amp; Jefferson 2012</xref>): (1) repair and replace structural elements or correct improperly designed features; (2) underpinning, particularly of key parts of the foundations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C16">Buzzi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> 2010</xref>); (3) provision of structural adjustments of additional structural support (e.g. post tensioning); (4) stiffening of foundations; (5) provision of drainage control; (6) stabilization of water contents of foundation soils; or (7) installation of moisture barriers to control water content fluctuations.</p>
<p>For pavements, the most common remedial measures are either removal and replacement or construction of overlays. Whichever method is used, care is needed to ensure that the causes of the original distress are dealt with. Remedial measures should aim to minimize volume changes, and options include: removal and replacement of expansive soil; use of additives to reduce volume change capacity; application of surcharge to confine soils if swell pressures are not too great; or minimizing moisture content changes in the subgrade. Many of the pre-construction approaches can also be applied to post-construction treatments, and for pavements these include: moisture barriers; removal, replacement and compaction; and drainage control (<xref ref-type="table" rid="EGSP29_8TB2">Table 8.2</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s10"><label>8.10</label><title>Shrink–swell soils and trees</title>
<p>Different problems are faced when considering the distinctly separate areas of designing new build structures or remediating existing damaged buildings. New build guidelines in terms of domestic dwellings recognizes the need for thorough ground investigations to design systems to cope with the hazards presented by the presence of existing trees or building following their recent removal. See NHBC Standards chapter 4.2 on building near trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C59">NHBC 2011</xref>) and NHBC Efficient Design of Foundations for Low Rise Housing, Design Guide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C58">NHBC 2010</xref>). In the case of existing dwellings, a range of reports and digests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C9">BRE 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C10">1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C11">1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C12">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C13">2002</xref>) and a summary of good technical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C26">Driscoll &amp; Skinner 2007</xref>) are available.</p>
<p>In the case of existing structures, the main cause of distress results from the effects of differential settlement where different parts of the building move by varying amounts due to differences in the properties of the underlying soil. Although significant in terms of vertical movement, equal or proportionate movements across the plan area of a building may result in little structural damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C35">ISE 1994</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C6">Biddle (2001)</xref> suggests the following remedial options to deal with the adverse actions of trees: (1) fell the offending tree to eliminate all future drying; (2) prune tree to reduce drying and the amplitude of seasonal movement; (3) control root spread to prevent drying under foundations; or (4) provide supplementary watering to prevent soil from drying.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C6">Biddle (2001)</xref>, in most situations underpinning is unnecessary and foundations can be stabilized by appropriate tree management, usually felling the offending tree or carrying out heavy crown reduction. Site investigations should reflect this change, and be aimed at providing information to allow appropriate decisions on tree management, in particular: (1) confirmation that vegetation-related subsidence is involved; (2) identification of which tree(s) or shrub(s) are involved; (3) assessment of the risk of heave if a tree is felled or managed; (4) identification of the need for any other site investigations; (5) if the tree warrants retention, assessment of whether partial underpinning would be sufficient; (6) confirmation that vegetation management has been effective in stabilizing the foundations; and (7) provision of information within an acceptable timescale.</p>
<p>Tree pruning to reduce its water use and therefore its influence on the surrounding soil is often employed. However, if the trees are thereafter not subjected to a frequent and ongoing regime of management, the problem will very quickly return and problems continue. While tree removal will ultimately provide an absolute solution in the majority of cases, there are situations where this is not an option (e.g. protected trees, adverse risk of heave, incomplete evidence in contentious issues, and physical proximity of trees). In addition, pruning is only an appropriate option in some circumstances with details discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C6">Biddle (2001)</xref>. If vegetation is involved, the greatest movement is usually closest to the culprit. Unless trees are very close to each other, the spatial distribution of movement can help to identify the culprit. The influence of trees is likely to be widespread, whereas shrubs are localized. The pattern of movement detected by level monitoring is sometimes unusual, for example, no movement where it might be expected, or vice versa. If so, other investigations can be formulated to try to explain the anomaly. For instance, if part of a building closest to a tree is not moving whereas other parts are, it might be because of previous partial underpinning. Trial pits at relevant locations can provide an answer. However, these must be appropriate as poorly obtained information is not reliable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C6">Biddle 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>If a mature tree is felled, consequential heave of a building on a clay soil can occur. Unfortunately, the evidence is rarely available. However, a number of clues can help and include: (1) the house is new (less than 20 years old); (2) there is expansive soil present; (3) the crack pattern might appear a bit odd (e.g. wider at the bottom than the top, with no obvious cause); or (4) cracks continue to open, even during wet months.</p>
<p>Heave problems can be costly and always require thorough investigation, involving soil sampling, precise levels and aerial photographs. Heave is a threat but rarely a reality where established existing properties are involved and the structure predates the planting of the tree. Ultimately, if the offending tree can be accurately targeted and dealt with rapidly before another growing season, the extent of any damage and need for remedial work will be kept to a minimum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EGSP29_8C6">Biddle 2001</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s11" sec-type="conclusions"><label>8.11</label><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Subsidence and heave caused by shrink–swell soils are probably the most significant geological hazards to affect domestic properties and other low-rise structures worldwide, costing billions of pounds annually. In a typical year, they cause a greater financial loss to property owners than earthquakes, floods, landslides, hurricanes and tornadoes combined. They are found throughout many regions of the world, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions, as well as in more humid regions such as the UK, where their problematic behaviour can be evident in highly plastic clay soils, especially after prolonged periods of drought. This shrink–swell effect is induced by changes in the water content of the ground causing subsidence or heave to occur, which can be exacerbated by external influences such as the presence of tree roots.</p>
<p>The shrink–swell hazard is controlled by a number of factors, primarily the geology and mineralogy (high-plasticity clays), and the climate (prolonged periods of dry weather). The seasonal volumetric behaviour of a desiccated soil is complex, and this complexity increases with severity of the shrinkage phenomena. The actual mechanism of volume increase (or decrease) and the differences in susceptibility to these processes can be attributed to a combination of both mechanical and physicochemical processes. Shrinkage and swelling usually occurs in the near-surface to depths of about 3 m; water content in this upper layer, generally termed the active zone, is significantly influenced by climatic and environmental factors. The shrink–swell potential of expansive soils is determined by its initial water content, void ratio, internal structure and vertical stresses, as well as the type and amount of clay minerals in the soil. Clay particles are very small and their shape is determined by the arrangement of the thin crystal lattice layers that they form. In an expansive clay, the molecular structure and arrangement of these clay crystal sheets has a particular affinity to attract and hold water molecules between the crystalline layers (and on their surfaces) in a strongly bonded ‘sandwich’, giving them a large shrink–swell potential. Seasonal volume change generally takes place with the assistance of fractures and secondary macropores within the weathered horizons.</p>
<p>Houses and other low-rise buildings, pavements, pylons, pipelines and other shallow services are especially vulnerable to damage from shrink–swell clays because they are less able to suppress differential movements than heavier multi-storey structures. Normal site investigations are often not adequate, and a more extensive examination is required to provide sufficient information. This may involve specialist test programmes even for relatively lightweight structures. A large number of factors influence foundation types and design methods, including climate, financial and legal aspects as well as technical issues. Often higher initial costs are offset many times over by a reduction in post-construction maintenance costs dealing with expansive soils. Pavements are highly susceptible to damage caused by shrink–swell soils; their vulnerability stems from their relative lightweight nature extended over a relatively large area. Building or paving on previously open areas of land can cause major disruption to the soil–water system. Sealing the ground in this way cuts off the infiltration of rainwater, meaning that the trees that are dependent upon this water will have to send their roots deeper or further afield. The movement of these root systems will cause a major ground disturbance and lead to the removal of water from a larger area around the tree. Tree pruning to reduce its water use and therefore its influence on the surrounding soil is often employed. However, if the trees are thereafter not subjected to a frequent and ongoing regime of management, the problem will very quickly return and problems continue. While tree removal will ultimately provide an absolute solution in the majority of cases, there are situations where this is not an option.</p>

<list-item><p><italic toggle="yes">Bearing capacity</italic>: The ability of a material to support an applied load. Ultimate bearing capacity is the pressure at which shear failure of the supporting soil immediately below and adjacent to a foundation occurs. A foundation is usually designed with a working load that is some proportion of the bearing capacity.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic toggle="yes">Clay</italic>: A naturally occurring material that is a plastic material at natural water content and hardens when dried to form a brittle material. It is the only type of soil and/or rock susceptible to significant shrinkage and swelling. It is made up mainly, but not exclusively, of clay minerals. It is defined by its particle-size range (&lt;0.002 mm). Clay does not have to be the dominant component of a soil in order to impart clay-like properties to it.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic toggle="yes">Clay minerals</italic>: A group of minerals with a layer lattice structure that occurs as minute platy or fibrous crystals. These tend to have a very large surface area compared with other minerals, giving clays their plastic nature and the ability to support large suction forces. They have the ability to take up and retain water and to undergo base exchange.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic toggle="yes">Density</italic>: The mass of a unit volume of a material. Often used (incorrectly) as synonym for unit weight. Usually qualified by condition of sample (e.g. saturated, dry).</p></list-item>
