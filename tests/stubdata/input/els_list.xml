					<ce:simple-para id="spara004" view="all">As part of planning for future space exploration, COSPAR (The Committee on Space Research) together with participating space agencies, organized and held interdisciplinary meetings to consider next steps in addressing knowledge gaps for planetary protection for future human missions to Mars. Beginning with the results of these meetings and earlier work by NASA, ESA, and COSPAR (e.g., Criswell et&#160;al., 2005; Hogan et&#160;al., 2006; Rummel et&#160;al., 2008) as a base the authors of this paper carried out a follow-on NASA planning activity to identify the necessary steps to be accomplished to close knowledge gaps. We identified significant overlap between the planetary protection needs and other sets of Mars preparation roadmaps (1) microbial monitoring requirements for crew health and medical systems, (2) studies of the microbiome of the built environment, (3) environmental control and life support systems (ECLSS), (4) waste management, and (5) planetary surface operations. In many cases, efforts to mature exploration class systems for Mars that are occurring in other domains can be leveraged with minor changes to address planetary protection gaps as well. In other cases, work planned for testing on the International Space Station (ISS) as an analog for crew Mars transit, or on the lunar surface as an analog for Mars surface operations can be used to close planetary protection technology and knowledge gaps. An overall strategic framework that combines these domains has the advantage of being more comprehensive, efficient, and timely for closing gaps.</ce:simple-para>
					<ce:simple-para id="spara005" view="all">This approach has led to the development of a NASA roadmap for addressing planetary protection integrated with other related roadmaps. NASA's development and execution of the planetary protection is now viewed in an integrated way with related technology development and testing.

					<ce:para id="para0006" view="all">When developing human Mars mission concepts, NASA acknowledges COSPAR policy (
						<ce:cross-ref id="crf0009" refid="bib0005">COSPAR,&#160;2021</ce:cross-ref>) as the guideline for protecting Mars from Earth Microbes and protecting Earth from possible Martian microbes. Artemis missions to the Moon will take place before human missions to Mars, but this paper focuses solely on planetary protection for Mars because the COSPAR policy for the Moon is relatively simple based on research that indicates there is no extant life on the Moon (
						<ce:cross-ref id="optYApMZEeTRF" refid="bib19">NASA,&#160;1971</ce:cross-ref>). COSPAR policy for the Moon requires documentation of organics delivered to the surface, and specifically for the polar regions, a list of volatiles onboard. Since we anticipate Mars will still be being investigated for evidence of past or present life after the Mars Sample Return mission (
						<ce:cross-ref id="crf0010" refid="bib0017">Tait&#160;et&#160;al., 2022</ce:cross-ref>), the envisaged requirements for human missions with regard to forward and backward contamination are much greater, but not impossible to meet (
						<ce:cross-ref id="crf0011" refid="fig0001">Fig.&#160;1</ce:cross-ref>

						<ce:cross-ref id="crf0012" refid="bib0005">COSPAR,&#160;2021</ce:cross-ref>) for crewed missions to Mars, is based on the text originally added to the policy in 2008, and is qualitative, lacking clear parameters that would help engineers design COSPAR compliant systems for human missions to the Red Planet. To develop quantitative requirements for a human mission to Mars, COSPAR, together with participating space agencies, has sponsored a series of interdisciplinary meetings to consider next steps in addressing knowledge gaps in the planetary protection discipline, ahead of future human missions to Mars and beyond. The objective is to incrementally move from the current qualitative COSPAR Planetary Protection &#x201c;Principles and Guidelines&#x201d; toward the development of quantitative Planetary Protection requirements for future human missions to deep space destinations like Mars. The workshops and meetings in this series have involved participants from COSPAR, the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the European Space Agency (ESA), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), other international space agencies, the scientific and technical community, and commercial and private stakeholders (

The earlier meetings first identified and then prioritized important knowledge gaps in science and technology areas related to planetary protection for crewed missions, including developing a timeline to assist in ensuring timely closure of the knowledge gaps. Subsequent meetings had considered implementation of strategies to close these knowledge gaps in the areas of &#x201c;Microbial and human health monitoring&#x201d;, the &#x201c;Natural transport of contamination on Mars&#x201d; and &#x201c;Technology and operations for contamination control&#x201d;, to determine potential strategies in managing the contamination in- and outflow of crewed systems on the surface of Mars. Following these workshops, NASA conducted an internal study on methods to prevent backward contamination from Mars and developed assumptions and guidelines concerning management of crew health and possible need for quarantine upon their return to Earth.

						<ce:para id="para0029" view="all">
							<ce:bold>Why:</ce:bold> The crew health requirements to perform in-flight microbial monitoring of ISS water, air, and surfaces reside within the ISS Medical Operations Requirements Document (MORD). As such, this monitoring has been performed routinely since the habitation of the first ISS module (
							<ce:cross-ref id="crf0029" refid="bib0003">Castro&#160;et&#160;al., &#160;2004</ce:cross-ref>; 
							<ce:cross-ref id="crf0030" refid="bib0018">Yamaguchi&#160;et&#160;al., 2014</ce:cross-ref>). The monitoring can be viewed as an assessment of microbial controls that are in place: are the HEPA filters clear and functioning, is the Water Processor Assembly (WPA) performing as designed, and are housekeeping operations being followed? The current monitoring practice relies on the crew collecting samples onto microbial growth media, five days of ambient temperature incubation, and performing a high-level quantification through comparison to a density chart. The slides or culture plates must then be returned to the ground for microbial identification. Following Earth-based analysis, this monitoring strategy provides approximate levels and identities of the cultured microorganisms, which are then used to assess overall risk. This data guides remediation based on both the overall levels as well as the medical significance of the organisms isolated. The ISS microbial monitoring practice has resulted in an overall healthy vehicle and crew, but the significant limitation is the requirement of sample return. Additionally, the reliance on culture produces both a bias to those organisms that can be cultured and a substantial delay between sample collection and analytical results. It is critical to establish and validate a means of near real-time environmental and human health diagnostics for exploration missions.

							<ce:bold>What:</ce:bold> Nanopore sequencing has become commonplace onboard the ISS, where continuous operations have occurred since 2016.

							<ce:italic>miniPCR</ce:italic> thermal cycler and Oxford Nanopore Technologies&#x2019; 
							<ce:italic>MinION</ce:italic> nucleic acid sequencer. Both platforms were tested onboard the ISS in 2016, marking the first PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and sequencing to take place beyond the bounds of Earth (
							<ce:cross-ref id="crf0031" refid="bib0004">Castro-Wallace&#160;et&#160;al., 2017</ce:cross-ref>; 
							<ce:cross-ref id="crf0032" refid="bib0001">Boguraev&#160;et&#160;al., 2017</ce:cross-ref>). Following these initial demonstrations, a method was developed around these technologies to aid in microbial identifications aboard the ISS. In 2017, a crewmember collected cells from a culture slide used for nominal microbial monitoring, extracted and amplified DNA, generated sequencing libraries, and sequenced the resulting DNA with the MinION (
							<ce:cross-ref id="crf0033" refid="bib0002">Burton&#160;et&#160;al., 2020</ce:cross-ref>) . From three colonies, two identifications were obtained. Following return of the culture slide to Earth and analysis following standard laboratory operating procedures, the two identifications obtained aboard the ISS were validated for the three colonies; two colonies were the same organism. This was the first-time that microbes had been collected, cultured, and identified off-Earth. To move beyond the need to culture potentially harmful microbes, a culture-independent, swab-to-sequencer process was developed and tested for the first-time aboard ISS in 2018. During this testing, two crewmembers performed four independent swab-to-sequencer experiments. The data revealed a high similarity with the human microbiome as well as previous culture-based ISS data (
							<ce:cross-ref id="crf0034" refid="bib0016">Stahl-Rommel&#160;et&#160;al., 2021</ce:cross-ref>). Not surprisingly, much higher diversity was noted with the swab-to-sequencer method in comparison to the historical culture-based data, as a significant number of difficult-to-culture microorganisms were present (
							<ce:cross-ref id="crf0035" refid="bib0016">Stahl-Rommel&#160;et&#160;al., 2021</ce:cross-ref>). Continued onboard validation of this swab-to-sequencer method for surface analysis is ongoing as a part of the ISS Crew Health Care Systems (CHeCS) standard medical operations testing with the goal of moving beyond culture-based analysis for exploration. Additionally, similar MinION-focused, culture-independent water and air analysis methods are undergoing laboratory testing with spaceflight demonstrations planned for the near future. This technology is amenable to a wide range of different sample matrices, expands insight beyond the limitations of traditional culture, and provides a means of in situ molecular characterization that is critical for the expansion of spaceflight missions. Importantly, significant evaluation of both ground- and ISS-generated molecular data has established that it is favorable for use in the current risk assessment framework.

For new exploration modules and vehicles, a pre-flight baseline of the air and surface microbiome should be established. For short-duration Gateway missions, sampling should occur at least once per mission. With the addition of new/changing architecture of systems (air and water revitalization), sampling should be performed as frequently as crew time allows, with monthly monitoring being ideal. With the routine use of a completed Gateway or lunar base, sampling could be reduced over time as insight is gained (similar to ISS).

							<ce:bold>How:</ce:bold> The following is a concept of operations for swab-based analysis. Air and water methods are in work with planned ISS demonstrations in 2023. Briefly, a swab is used to collect a sample from an internal (IVA) or external (EVA) surface. All subsequent steps will take place within a glovebox. Cells from the swab are lysed to free DNA using a combination of enzymes and heat. A paramagnetic bead-based purification can then be used to purify the extracted DNA from the cellular debris (

The purified DNA will then be subjected to amplification within miniPCR as required by the scientific goals. Following amplification or other barcoding strategy, all samples will be pooled into one reaction and purified using the same bead-based approach, as previously employed. Sequencing libraries will be generated from the purified product by the addition of reagents followed by a brief incubation at ambient temperature. After placing a flow cell into the MinION, the prepared sequencing libraries will be injected into the flow cell, and sequencing will be initiated through the graphical user interface on the MinION screen. Following completion of the run, the data will be transferred from the MinION for in-depth analysis to inform decision making aimed at risk assessment, maintaining cleanliness levels, and other needed planetary protection actions.

						<ce:para id="para0035" view="all">
							<ce:bold>Why:</ce:bold> The microorganisms of Earth's biosphere are ubiquitous, including in engineered vehicles, and humans. It is virtually impossible to maintain a microbiology-free environment in any closed or open systems. If an engineered vehicle comes into direct or indirect contact with humans and other non-sterile surfaces and environments, microbiological transfer can take place. Thus, it is a given fact that where humans and their engineering products go in the solar systems, the associated microorganisms will travel to those destinations, too. As a result, a risk to contamination of exploration destinations exists that could compromise studies to discover, identify, and study indigenous life and their organic chemical signatures on other planets and potentially may seed life at those destinations. Conversely, if viable microbiological organisms are discovered on other planets, the risks exist that these organisms could colonize vehicles and astronauts resulting in the unintentional return to and contamination of the Earth's ecosystem. Therefore, studies are necessary to understand microbial ecosystems and their dynamics concerning mobility, transfer, and survivability in order to accurately define the level of risk, risk factors, and risk mitigation actions concerning human exploration on other planets and return to Earth.

						<ce:para id="para0036" view="all">
							<ce:bold>What:</ce:bold> The current microbiological characterization and monitoring studies of the built environment conducted on ISS do not faithfully replicate the environment of deep space, the Moon (as an exploration analog for Mars), and Mars. The ISS has relatively little material and equipment transfer from the interior to the exterior compared to Mars estimates where there will be a high EVA frequency (
							<ce:cross-ref id="crf0038" refid="bib0010">NASA,&#160;2022b</ce:cross-ref>). Furthermore, data concerning mechanisms and modes of microbial migration, transfer, and survival within a vehicle are very limited, including for data available for these same factors for microorganisms on the external surfaces of a space vehicle. Therefore, studies are necessary that investigate microbial ecosystems of exploration vehicles and the astronauts in the actual environment where these missions will occur. The data from microbiological studies conducted in deep space and the lunar environment are critical for understanding the future risk to Mars exploration. The data is important for identifying and filling knowledge gaps concerning microbial mobility, transfer, and survival as it relates to risks to forward contamination of Mars and backward contamination to Earth. Ultimately, the data from these studies will result in developing models of microbial ecosystems and dynamics that may be used for Mars and beyond exploration and defining effective engineering solutions to mitigate risks for microbial contamination.

							<ce:bold>Why:</ce:bold> The existing number of disinfection agents compatible for use in a closed space habitat is limited by compatibly with life support equipment, human toxicity, and shelf life. Currently each system and payload independently manifests cleaning and disinfectant wipes and they are not necessarily interchangeable. While wet wipe consumables are readily launched from earth to ISS, deep space missions will require each system planning for its own consumables nominal plus contingencies which can increase overall vehicle departure mass or increased mission and or science completion risks. Currently, no disinfectants are generated in-mission. Wipes are launched wet and individually packaged, with the liquid disinfectant fraction represents &#x223c;80% of the overall wipe mass. If the liquid disinfectant could be generated on orbit and applied to a wipe, then only dry wipes would need to be launched. This would provide a mass savings. It also allows disinfectant to be used for other applications for more extensive cleaning, of interest to PP, of surfaces, tools, or spacesuit components than can be achieved today. For long duration surface missions, laundry of clothing begins to trade favorably over disposable clothing. Once laundry is developed, the wipe substrate could also be laundered if the disinfectant solution is able to be generated. This would reduce the need for launching contingency wipe supplies if wipe reuse is possible.

Ammonia and halogenated disinfectant solvents can irritate crew or animal senses and contaminate material science in addition to being a challenge for trace contaminant removal systems.

Halogens can also damage catalysts and degrade their performance. Disinfectants that decompose to hydrogen and oxygen (e.g., H

						<ce:para id="para0043" view="all">
							<ce:bold>What:</ce:bold> An integrated in-mission production of disinfection agents is needed.

A conceptual implementation would be to generate a range of concentrations and volumes of disinfectant solutions. The solution could be applied to dry wipes thereby saving &#x223c;80% of current wet wipe launch mass. Sharing a common dry wipe could reduce contingency wipe mass. It may be possible to reapply disinfectant solution to a wipe (particularly in partial gravity) to allow increased ability to clean larger surface areas. A liquid disinfectant could be aerosolized to provide gaseous treatment of gloveboxes or other spacecraft volumes. Notionally, hydrogen peroxide can be generated from life support portable water used on a wipe or made into an aerosol. The hydrogen peroxide will reduce to oxygen and water with will then be recycled via removal of water vapor from the cabin air via the condensing heat exchanger.

Ideally this technology should be further matured leading to an ISS technology demonstration starting in 2026 to inform critical design reviews for lunar surface habitats and Mars transit elements in the 2027&#x2013;2029 timeframe. The ISS technology demonstration should continue through FY29 to represent at least 3 years of microgravity operation. This should be augmented with ground testing to understand consumable/spares life.

					<ce:para id="para0047" view="all">The planetary protection example Use Cases presented lead to needed closure of the knowledge and technology gaps. There were three examples discussed but more need to be addressed. Additional examples to be developed include waste disposal/management on the Mars surface, en-route to Mars and in Mars orbit, spacesuit leakage rates of viable microbes, and others. Knowledge gap closure is essential for development of planetary protection policy and developing requirements for crewed missions to Mars. This will enable timely flow down of Agency level Planetary Protection requirements and adoption into spacecraft design and architecture requirements. Thoughtful and collaborative investments are essential to close these knowledge gaps.</ce:para>
					<ce:para id="para0048" view="all">It is important to remember that this a roadmap on how to close the knowledge gaps and not the only roadmap. It will need to be updated as we fill in some of the roadmaps or develop new technologies.
