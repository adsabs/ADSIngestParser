Healthy male and female participants (18-55 years old) with a complete COVID-19-primary vaccine scheme were assigned to receive two intramuscular doses of either a low-dose or a high-dose of ARVAC CG. The primary endpoint was safety. The secondary objective was humoral immunogenicity. Cellular immune responses were studied as an exploratory objective. The trial was prospectively registered in PRIISA.BA (Registration Code 6564) and ANMAT and retrospectively registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05656508). Samples from participants of a surveillance strategy implemented by the Ministry of Health of the Province of Buenos Aires that were boosted with BNT162b2 were also analyzed to compare with the booster effect of ARVAC CG. ARVAC CG exhibits a satisfactory safety profile, a robust and broad booster response of neutralizing antibodies against the Ancestral strain of SARS-CoV-2 and the Gamma, Delta, Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.5 variants of concern and a booster effect on T cell immunity in individuals previously immunized with different COVID-19 vaccine platforms.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2"

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">The severe acute respiratory virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in November 2019 and soon thereafter, emerging new viral variants dramatically impacted the dynamics of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread, globally. These virus variants are, in general, more contagious than previous strains. Moreover, some variants are capable of immunological and/or therapeutic escape<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Numerous vaccines have been developed and proved effective to protect against severe disease, hospitalization, and fatal outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In Argentina, several platforms of COVID-19 vaccines have been introduced, including inactivated vaccines (BBIBP-CorV), viral vectored vaccines (Sputnik V, AZD1222, CanSino), and mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273), resulting in a significant coverage of the population with complete primary vaccine series<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. However, due to waning immunity and emergence of highly transmissible immune escape viral variants, two-dose COVID-19 vaccination programs may have not been enough to prevent breakthrough infections caused by these variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Clinical studies suggest that boosting with variant-adapted vaccines would optimize vaccine efficacy (VE) inducing strong and broad immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The pandemic has disproportionately affected low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which make up about 85% of the world population. Therefore, pandemic remains a threat unless most people get vaccinated. In response to the constraints imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the limited access of many Latin American countries to costly vaccines, Laboratorio Pablo Cassará S.R.L., an Argentinian pharmaceutical company, launched a vaccine development program against SARS-CoV-2. ARVAC CG is a receptor binding domain (RBD)-based protein aluminum hydroxide-adjuvanted vaccine candidate that was designed and produced entirely in Argentina to be used as booster or primary vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine is a variant-adapted vaccine based on the highly immune evasive Gamma SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC). Non-clinical studies of this vaccine prototype in mice indicated that the Gamma-variant vaccine-candidate is more immunogenic and induces a broader nAb response than the Ancestral vaccine-candidate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">In this interim report safety and immunogenicity data after a booster dose of ARVAC CG vaccine from an ongoing first in human phase 1 study are presented. ARVAC CG exhibits a satisfactory safety profile, a robust and broad booster response of neutralizing antibodies against the Ancestral strain of SARS-CoV-2, the Gamma variant, and other VOCs (Delta, Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.5) and a booster effect on T cell immunity when used as booster in individuals previously immunized with different COVID-19 vaccine platforms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Population characteristics and local and systemic adverse events</title><p id="Par7">The flowchart of the study is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Demographic characteristics of the participants are presented in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Vaccination with ARVAC CG was well tolerated, with mild-to-moderate reactogenicity profiles (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>).

Moreover, the ARVAC CG 50 μg dose outperformed the 25 μg dose in terms of nAb titers reached against the Ancestral and Omicron BA.1 viral variants and 10×-seroconversion rates in nAb against Omicron BA.1. The booster effect after one dose of ARVAC CG vaccine was evident despite the variety of immunization schemes received by the study participants.</p><p id="Par27">The differences in the proportions of subjects with different types of primary vaccine regimen in the low-dose and the high-dose groups may difficult comparisons. However, the possibility to include different primary vaccination schemes was important in this phase 1 study to have a representation of the diversity in primary vaccination schemes that were used in Argentina. Since most individuals in group B had received the BBIBP-CorV vaccine as primary vaccination regimen and there were approximately equal numbers of BBIBP-CorV recipients in the high and low dose groups, the comparison of these subgroups was also performed. Similar to the findings when all volunteers were included, in these more homogeneous subpopulations, the 50 µg dose was consistently more immunogenic than the 25 µg dose. Although the time since prior COVID-19 declared by participants was quite different between the high and low dose groups and this could be a limitation, the analysis of anti-N in sera of all individuals indicated that both populations were similar in their inferred previous exposure to the virus and that the immune responses after vaccination are independent of previous infection status.</p><p id="Par28">With the emergence of new VOCs it is clear that breakthrough infections can occur in vaccinated persons, including those with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Therefore, the capability to boost the immune responses in individuals with a previous history of infection becomes critical, enhancing protection against COVID-19 and post-COVID conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The results of this study highlight the potential benefit of the ARVAC CG vaccine for all populations regardless of their prior COVID-19 serological status.</p><p id="Par29">The performance of the ARVAC CG booster dose regarding nAb GMTs and GMFR, was similar to that of the BNT162b2 booster against Ancestral and Delta VOCs, but better for Gamma, Omicron BA.1 and BA.5 VOCs. Similarly, booster shots with Beta variant-based vaccines elicit broad nAb responses against the Ancestral, the Beta and the Omicron BA.1 VOC, which were higher than that elicited by a booster with an ancestral-variant based vaccine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.

In this regard, nAb levels of ~100-120 IU/ml have been correlated with ~80% VE against symptomatic infection, whereas nAb levels of ~900-1030 IU/ml correlate with ~90% VE against symptomatic infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Results presented here suggest that a booster with ARVAC CG significantly increases the proportion of individuals with nAb titers that correlate with high VE.</p><p id="Par31">T-cell immunity is crucial to combat acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and for the development of long-term immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. While antibody titers tend to wane rapidly and show limited neutralizing activity to newly arising VOCs, T-cell memory is largely conserved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. ARVAC CG boosted T cell immunity, which might contribute to eliminate virus-infected cells. Although it has been reported that durable spike-specific T-cell responses after different COVID-19 primary vaccination regimens are not further enhanced by an mRNA booster<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, results presented here show that ARVAC CG booster significantly increases the proportion of antigen-specific IFN-γ and IL-4 producing T cells in individuals previously vaccinated with different primary schemes.</p><p id="Par32">One limitation of this study is the lack of randomization for volunteers. Nevertheless, despite the sequential study design, enrolment dates of the booster groups occurred within weeks of each other, representing similar epidemiologic environments of circulating variants. The comparison of the immunogenicity results of ARVAC CG cohorts with those of a contemporaneous BNT162b2 booster study has another limitation, since the study participants presented some demographic differences in their ages (36.5 in BNT162b2 group versus 32 and 27 years in groups A and B, respectively). Although the time from last SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose (4.2 months in the BNT162b2 boosted subjects versus 7.9 and 6.6 months in group A and B, respectively) was different this did not influence the immune outcomes in this study. Peak of nAb titers reached after booster in both ARVAC CG cohorts were similar whether the time since primary vaccination completion to booster was short ( &lt; 180 days) or long (≥ 180 days). Indeed, ARVAC CG boosters at short time ( &lt; 180 days) showed a better performance than BNT162b2 booster. The confirmed previous SARS-CoV-2 infection history (0% in group BNT162b2 versus 8% and 20% in groups A and B, respectively) was quite different, nevertheless anti-N antibodies serology indicated that the three populations had similar proportions of seropositive individuals and might had similar previous contact with the virus. The proportion of primary vaccination schemes was also different, since most individuals in BNT162b2 boosted cohort had received the rAd26/rAd5 (Sputnik V) vaccine as primary vaccination regimen, however the comparison among subjects with the same primary vaccination led to similar results.</p><p id="Par33">In this phase 1 study, safety was demonstrated after two ARVAC CG administrations highlighting that ARVAC CG is safe. Immune responses after a single booster dose could be assessed only after 14 and 28 days of administration. After the second ARVAC CG administration the nAb remained significantly higher than baseline but no booster effect was observed. The lack of booster effect may be due to the short interval between boosters, that may not be the optimal in terms of immunological performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Longer-term follow-up of immune responses after a single booster dose will have to be studied in an ongoing phase 2/3 study.</p><p id="Par34">While both formulations of ARVAC CG exhibited a favorable safety and reactogenicity profile eliciting broadly nAb responses and T cell immunity against SARS-CoV-2, the 50 µg dose outperformed the 25 µg dose in certain of the immunogenicity variables evaluated. Therefore, the 50 µg dose vaccine is currently being tested in an ongoing Phase 2/3 study to evaluate its safety, and immunogenicity in a larger population. Selection of the 50 µg vaccine dose allowed the testing of a bivalent vaccine containing 25 µg of Gamma-based antigen plus 25 µg of Omicron BA.5-based antigen to improve the response capacity, as part of a Phase 2/3 study, in accordance with the recommendations from the advisory committee on immunization practices for the use of bivalent booster doses of COVID-19 vaccines to increase protection against circulating VOCs and to broaden neutralization to previous and potentially yet-to-emerge variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par35">There is a need for widespread immunization programs with new generation of COVID-19 booster vaccines which provide a wide breadth of protection against constantly emerging SARS-Cov-2 variants. Nonetheless, LMICs lag far behind in this effort due to limitations in affordability and accessibility to vaccines. Hence, developments such as ARVAC CG may offer an opportunity to overcome some of these challenges and improve the response capacity of many countries, worldwide.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Trial design and oversight</title><p id="Par36">The trial was prospectively registered in PRIISA.BA (Registration Code 6564) and in ANMAT.

The participant was completely asymptomatic and following protocol instructions the application of the second dose was delayed. While the safety data of this volunteer at 28 days and after the second booster are included, the immunogenicity data at day 28 and at later time points were excluded because the immunogenicity against the virus may shape the antibody response and lead to misinterpretation of the results.
