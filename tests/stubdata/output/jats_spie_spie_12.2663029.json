    "textEnglish": "Single photon counting avalanche diodes (SPADs) are versatile sensors for active and time-correlated measurements such as ranging and fluorescence imaging. These detectors also have great potential for passive or uncorrelated imaging. Recently, it was demonstrated that passive imaging of photon flux is possible by determining the mean photon arrival time. For ambient light illumination, timestamp data can be interpreted as a metric for the photon impingement rate. Various applications have been investigated including high-dynamic-range imaging, single-photon imaging, and capture of fast-moving objects or dynamic scenes. However, the appearance of noise and motion blur requires sophisticated signal processing that enables sub-pixel resolution imaging and reconstruction of the scene by motion compensation. In this paper, we present new results on the evaluation of global scene motion. In our approach, motion is intentionally generated by a rotating wedge prism, resulting in continuous global motion on a circular path. We have studied scenes with different optical contrast."
